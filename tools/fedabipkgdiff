#
# You might have known that abipkgdiff is a command line tool to compare two
# RPM packages to find potential differences of ABI. This is really useful for
# Fedora packagers and developers. Usually, excpet the RPM packages built
# locally, if a packager wants to compare RPM packages he just built with
# specific RPM packages that were already built and availabe in Koji,
# fedabipkgdiff is the right tool for him.
#
# With fedabipkgdiff, packager is able to specify certain criteria to tell
# fedabipkgdiff which RPM packages he wants to compare, then fedabipkgdiff will
# find them, download them, and boom, run the abipkgdiff for you.
#
# Currently, fedabipkgdiff returns 0 if everything works well, otherwise, 1 if
# something wrong.
